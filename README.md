# Typist
Typist helps make your prototypes look so so real by turning text layers into animated, typing text components.

## What Typist does
Typist generates components for you from text layers in your Figma file. These can help dial up the realism on your presentations and can be indispensable for stress-testing text-based chat UI. The components that Typist generates are animated based on your preferences, and all you have to do is drop them into your prototype to get some of your very own RAD TEXT TYPING ACTION.

## How to use Typist
* Select one or more text layers in your Figma file and run the plugin.
* Specify how you want the typing animation to look.
* Hit the "Create component" button to generate components from your selected text layers.
* Use those components as you wish in your prototypes.
